# Aptos Faucet Tutorial

## What is a faucet?

The term “Faucet” literally means a water tap, but in the context of the blockchain ecosystem, it refers to the act of receiving a small amount of native tokens to execute transactions. In Aptos, you can receive up to 1 APT per faucet request. On the Devnet, the limit is 100 requests per day per IP address, while on the Testnet, the limit is 10 requests per day per IP address.
